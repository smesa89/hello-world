# hello-world
my first project

I am ready to depart my mechanical engineering and customer service career to pursue software and application development
as well as a user interface to make automation of hydroponic systems for vegetable and at home gardening possible from a
mobile platform.

I am taking this on so that I can have the liberty of working from wherever I want and improving my employability and job security
